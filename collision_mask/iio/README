This is a collection of C functions (not a library), for reading small images
in many formats.

To use the functions, copy the "iio.c" and "iio.h" files into your source code.
Edit the macros at the start of "iio.c" to fine-tune your library requirements.


iio.h                     interface (main source of documentation)
iio.c                     implementation

doc/                      documentation (mostly philosohpical)
misc/*.c                  example programs
misc/fes*                 examples of compilation with different compilers
samples/*                 test images
contrib/cmake/            cmake helper files
